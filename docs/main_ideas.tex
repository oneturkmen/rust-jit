My paper mainly focuses on a subset of Rust language, particularly borrow checker.
I have not yet implemented the support for lifetimes; concurrency and closures; templates
and generic programming; and some others. However, as I will describe later,
the challenge mostly lies in separating static (dataflow) analysis such as borrow
checking from the core compilation logic (i.e., code generation).

\textcolor{red}{provide a high-level architecture, i.e. the front-end, environment,
and interpreter components}.

\textcolor{red}{describe how you implemented borrow checking with points-to sets}.
