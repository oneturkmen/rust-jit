I did not perform any benchmarking or evaluation
program because the dynamic compilation infrastructure
does not support ``enough'' of the language yet.
There are, however, official benchmarks that Rust
compiler is evaluated against. These are the
programs that I plan to verify my main ideas (hypothesis)
against, to see how well a dynamic compilation system works.

As such, there is currently only support for
unary, binary expressions; variable declaration
statements; assignment statement expressions;
as well as references (accessing an address,
or equivalently, dereferencing an element).
The next step would be to introduce a notion of \textit{scope}
(as well as functions) into the program.
After scopes, functions, lifetimes, and (at least) closures
I could perform benchmarking against the set of programs
provided by Rust community. \textcolor{red}{cite benchmark Rust programs
+ state that in presentation, but show example}
