There is currently no dynamic compiler
(whether an interpreter or JIT) that entirely supports
Rust. For example, there is 
HolyJit, a "generic purpose just-in-time compiler for Rust"
\textcolor{red}{cite Holyjit repo}. It extends static Rust compiler by
obtaining its intermediate representation (MIR) and converts it into a
representation for the JIT compiler from HolyJit library. Despite supporting
much more language features than my system, there is currently no one working
actively on the project.  As it has been inactive since mid-2018, not much can
be done given that Rust itself evolves quite rapidly (e.g., it has recently
introduced \texttt{async/await} into
the language).

Nevertheless, the Rust compiler, \texttt{rustc}, is also getting
faster ``with every commit''. Section 1 briefly desribes
the performance of the default Rust compiler.
